Since 2017, Abbeey, a crypto enthusiast and AI prompt tinkerer, has been involved in the blockchain space.  He spends his time creating, writing, and sometimes memeing about the internet's future since he has a talent for deciphering tech trends and making AI reasoning simpler.

 He founded Abbeey Labs as a private concept laboratory that combined digital innovation, blockchain trials, and quick engineering.  Off-screen?  He's likely to be debugging prompts or drinking a strong cup of coffee while thinking about the next bull run.
